        <h3 class="mt-5">Arbitration</h3>
        <p>
          In the event the parties are not able to resolve any dispute between

          provisions hereof, whether in contract, tort, or otherwise at law or
          in equity for damages or any other relief, then such dispute shall be
          resolved only by final and binding arbitration pursuant to the Federal
          Arbitration Act, conducted by a single neutral arbitrator and
          administered by the American Arbitration Association, or a similar
          arbitration service selected by the parties, in a location mutually
          agreed upon by the parties. The arbitrators award shall be final, and

          the event that any legal or equitable action, proceeding or
          arbitration arises out of or concerns these Terms and Conditions, the

          indirectly, including Tort claims that are a result of these Terms and

          individual basis; class arbitrations and
          class/representative/collective actions are not permitted. THE PARTIES
          AGREE THAT A PARTY MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN EACH'S
          INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY
          PUTATIVE CLASS, COLLECTIVE AND/ OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, SUCH AS
          IN THE FORM OF A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION AGAINST THE OTHER.
          Further, unless both you and Employer agree otherwise, the arbitrator
          may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not
          otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class
          proceeding.
