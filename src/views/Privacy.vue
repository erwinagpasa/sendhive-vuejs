          inform you of other products or services available from SendHive and

        <p>
          SendHive does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third
          parties.
        </p>

        <p>
          SendHive may share data with trusted partners to help perform
          statistical analysis, send you email or postal mail, provide customer
          support, or arrange for deliveries. All such third parties are
          prohibited from using your personal information except to provide
          these services to IP Oven, and they are required to maintain the
          confidentiality of your information.
        </p>

        <p>
          SendHive may keep track of the websites and pages our users visit
          within IP Oven, in order to determine what SendHive services are the
          most popular. This data is used to deliver customized content and

        <h3 class="mt-5">Use of Cookies</h3>

        <p>
          The SendHive website may use "cookies" to help you personalize your
          online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard
          disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or
          deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to
          you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued
          the cookie to you.
        </p>

        <p>
          One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience
          feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web
          server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you
          personalize SendHive pages, or register with SendHive site or
          services, a cookie helps SendHive to recall your specific information
          on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your
          personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses,
          and so on. When you return to the same SendHive website, the
          information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can
          easily use the SendHive features that you customized.
        </p>

        <p>
          You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers
          automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser
          setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline
          cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive
          features of the SendHive services or websites you visit.
        </p>

        <h3 class="mt-5">Security of your Personal Information</h3>
        <p>
          To secure your personal information from unauthorized access, use or
          disclosure, SendHive uses the following:
        </p>

        <p>GeoTrust</p>

        <p>
          When personal information (such as a credit card number) is
          transmitted to other websites, it is protected through the use of
          encryption, such as the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol.
        </p>

        <h3 class="mt-5">Children Under Thirteen</h3>

        <p>
          SendHive does not knowingly collect personally identifiable
          information from children under the age of thirteen. If you are under
          the age of thirteen, you must ask your parent or guardian for
          permission to use this website.
