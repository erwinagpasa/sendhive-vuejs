            Ecommerce was built to unite unique people with unique goods online.
            At SendHive, we know that independent shops are what keeps the world
            interesting.

            Our mission is to help brands grow by giving everyone the same
            powerful automation tools as the big guys. Weâ€™re here to help brands
            fight back against the powers that be: impersonal giants like
            Amazon. We like to call this the ecommerce rebellion.
